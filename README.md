# 🚀 login-test-cypress
## 👋 Welcome!

This is a little exercise I did to start learning **Cypress** instead of watching a bunch of tutorials.  
I have created a small **login page** (can be found on my profile) and then proceeded to write **test cases** for it and automate them using Cypress.

### 🔍 Features
- Utilizes **Applitools Eyes** for visual cross-browser testing.
- Replaces Cypress native assertions with **visual testing**.

### 📜 Link to Test Cases
[🔗 Google Spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AoMbWCqXHu0Tp6hUYj_Ff3wvJDvaxpoyDl6toNEghJw/edit?usp=sharing)

### 🛠 Running the Tests
To run the tests, make sure to:
1. **Add an API key** in `applitools.config.js` (get it for free from Applitools after creating an account).
2. **Alternatively**, comment out the test and any mentions of Applitools Eyes to run the Cypress tests normally.

Happy Testing! 🎯✨
