# 🚀 login-test-cypress
## 👋 Welcome!

This is a little exercise I did to start learning **Cypress** instead of watching a bunch of tutorials.  
I have created a small **login page** (can be found on my profile) and then proceeded to write **test cases** for it and automate them using Cypress.
This happened 3 years ago so I am currently modernizing the tests and making them e2e, and not only the login page.
### 🔍 Features
- Using Page Object Model.

### 📜 Link to Test Cases

Happy Testing! 🎯✨
